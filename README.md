## 📊 CUSTOMER RETENTION & CHURN ANALYSIS

# 3️⃣ Causes of Customer Churn (Fashion Industry Context)

### ⚠ Price Sensitivity

Heavy competition from:

* Zara
* H&M
* ONLY

### ⚠ Trend Obsolescence

Fast-changing fashion preferences.

### ⚠ Discount Dependency

Customers wait for end-of-season sales.

### ⚠ Poor Omnichannel Experience

Mismatch between online & offline pricing or availability.

### ⚠ Quality or Fit Issues

Higher return rates in online orders.

# 4️⃣ Hypothetical Retention Analysis Example

Assume:

* Customers at start of year: 50,000
* New customers acquired: 20,000
* Customers at end of year: 55,000

[
Retention\ Rate = \frac{55,000 - 20,000}{50,000} \times 100 = 70%
]

👉 Churn Rate = 30%

Interpretation:

* 30% customers did not return.
* Growth depends heavily on acquiring new customers.
* Profitability may be under pressure.

---

# 5️⃣ Cohort Analysis (Important for Madame)

Track customers by first purchase month.

Example:

| Cohort | Month 1 | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 12 |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Jan    | 100%    | 60%     | 45%     | 30%      |
| Feb    | 100%    | 55%     | 40%     | 28%      |

Declining retention after 3 months indicates:

* Low repeat engagement
* Poor loyalty program effectiveness

---

# 6️⃣ RFM Analysis Model

Segment customers based on:

* **R (Recency)** – Last purchase date
* **F (Frequency)** – Purchase frequency
* **M (Monetary)** – Spending level

### High-Value Segment:

Recent + Frequent + High spending → Target for loyalty & exclusives

### At-Risk Segment:

High past spending but no recent purchase → Send win-back campaigns
